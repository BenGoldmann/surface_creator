# surface_creator

Surface creator is a tool for making slabs of solids for MD simulatons. It has features for defining exposed Miller plane and slab dimensions.

For each material, there is a `.cif` structure file that contains an orthorombic unit cell of the structure and a `.py` script that contains a function for creating the slab from the structure file.
